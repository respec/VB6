C     TA_UNITS_PER_BRANCH - gives the assumed average number of 
C       tributary area units per branch.  A unit is any collection
C       of tributrary areas flowing into a contiguous series of 
C       computational elements on a branch.  If branch mode of
C       tributary input is used then the unit is the tributary
C       area for the branch.  If the station mode is used it 
C       is the tributary area for each station interval.  Finally
C       if node mode is used it is the tributary area for a 
C       single node on the branch.  These are all called 
C       tributrary area units because the computations treat
C       them as a unit in the diffuse runoff calculations
C       of runoff amount, effect of detention reservoirs, and
C       effect of delay reservoirs.  

C     MXR_TRIBA - maximum number of rows given to the TRIBA array.
C                 This is also the max number of trib-area units.
C     MXN_DTEN  - maximum number of detention reservoirs

C     MXN_DLAY  - maximum number of delay reservoirs

C     TAM_MXNI  - maximum number of entries in TAM_ITAB, the 
C                 tributary area management integer vector.
C     TAM_MXNF  - maximum number of entries in TAM_FTAB, the
C                 tributrary area management floating point vector. 


C     MNGATE- maximum number of gates for output of special values to
C             the special output file.

C     MNSPROW-maximum number of extra rows allowed in special output.
C             There are always 2 rows by default.  The rows defined
C             by this parameter are in addition to the original 2 
C             rows. 

C     MXN_TS -maximum number of unique time-series references allowed.
C             The same time series may appear more than once but is
C             only counted once for MXN_TS accounting. 

C     MXN_TS - maximum number of unique time-series allowed.  
C              Excludes those involved in the diffuse inflow
C              computations.  Counts time series from files
C              as well as from function tables.  Each time
C              series is counted only once even if it is
C              used in more than one location.  In other words,
C              MXN_TS counts the number of unique sources for
C              time-series data.  The number of destinations,
C              that is, locations in the model, where a time
C              series of any kind is used, is counted  within
C              MXN_DEST.  
C              
C     MXN_DEST-maximum number of time-series destinations counting any
C              duplicates. Those counted are those that have 
C              destinations of forced boundary, evaporation on 
C              water surfaces, precipitation on water surfaces, 
C              and others yet to come that will be attached at
C              various points in a FEQ model. 

C     MXN_LU_G - maximum number of land uses per gage. 

C     MXN_IRRIG -maximum number of tributary-area units supporting
C                irrigation withsdrawals.  This will be set to
