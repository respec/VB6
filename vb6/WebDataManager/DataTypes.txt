The current version of the download tool gets some data from the
BASINS web site. This data is packaged in self-extracting zip
files with one file per 8-digit HUC per data type. There are
various reasons for hosting data here - some was not available
for download elsewhere, some was not available in a format useful
to BASINS, some required processing to produce.

The first file downloaded while creating a new BASINS
project contains a set of shape files including:

8-digit HUC boundaries
county boundaries
state boundaries
ecoregion boundaries
EPA region boundaries
urban area boundaries
major roads
gage sites
PCS sites
weather station sites
RF1 streams

Other data available as separate downloads from the
same place (also downloaded by the current tool): 

303d
Census (block groups, tracts, ZIP codes, population figures...)
DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
DEM Grid
NED (National Elevation Dataset)
NHD (National Hydrography Dataset)
GIRAS Land Use
Legacy STORET
Two types are packaged by state rather than by HUC:
Meteorological data 
STATSGO (for use by SWAT)

Other data types that the current tool downloads from other sites
includes:

NHD Geodatabase (by 4-digit HUC)
