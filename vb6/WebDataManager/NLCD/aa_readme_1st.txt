Dear User,

NO warranty is expressed or implied regarding the utility of these data.  Read the cautionary below.

If you are planning to use these data in Erdas Imagine or Arc/Info or ArcView, be sure to download 
the flat2erdas.txt file or flat2grid.txt file which explains how to import a flat file into these 
software packages (this does not constitute an endorsement of Erdas Image or Arc/Info, ArcView)
If you are using another software package, please download and read each of these files.  They 
should give you enough insight in order to import the data into your software.  A NCLD user has 
developed and submitted an Arc/Info aml which will automatically generate a Grid using the files 
downloaded from this site.  It is called 'proc.aml' and contains internal documentation. We also 
provide files which show the Red Green and Blue values used to create the colors shown on the web 
site.  They are nlcd_colors_1.txt (RGB vaules in the range of 0-1) and nlcd_colors_255.txt (RGB 
values in the range of 0-255).

The National Land Cover Data (NLCD) for some of the states available on this FTP site are 'preliminary',
meaning subject to revision. The date of the latest revision is shown by the date stamp in the file 
name (i.e. 092800 means September 28, 2000). Other states have been finalized and are identified by 
the word 'final' in the file name. The 'final' datasets on the FTP site are thematically identical to 
data available on CDs. The only difference is that the files on the FTP site are 8 bit binary files, 
while the data on the CDs are Geo-TIFFs. 

To order the CD go to : http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/programs/lccp/mrlcreg.html

The Land Cover Program at the USGS EROS Data Center would like to invite you to become a registered user
of the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). Providing the requested information will help us understand our
customer's applications and improve the next national land cover product (NLCD 2001). We will also be 
able to inform you of new developments (accuracy assessments, updates, etc.) Please also download 
aa_usersurvey.txt and email your responses to lcac@edcmail.cr.usgs.gov.  Thank you.

You will need to download at least two files, maybe three. One is a compressed 8 bit binary file (for 
example delaware_NLCD_flat052799.bin.gz) containing the land cover data, the second 
(delaware_readme_ver052799.txt) is a text file containing projection and other important information.
FGDC compliant metadata is also available for the states that are 'final.' They have the following 
naming convention 'state'_FGDC.txt (i.e. delaware_FGDC.txt). 

Lastly, you might want to download either flat2erdas.txt or flat2grid.txt. The first describes how to 
ingest the flat file into ERDAS Imagine. The second describes how to ingest the flat file into ARC/GRID 
or ARC/VIEW.

Important Caution Advisory:

These data can be used in a geographic information system (GIS) for any number of purposes such 
assessing wildlife habitat, water quality, pesticide runoff, land use change, etc. However, the user 
must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the resulting limitations of these 
data.

The National Land Cover Dataset was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a 
spatial resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where available). The 
analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-
state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial 
photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a 
spatially broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal 
regions’ that are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the 
state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region.

With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient 
reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation 
must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s.
