AuthorDoc conversion recognizes the following tags:

<h>Header of Section</h>
Header levels are handled by the converter. The indentation of the
filename in the project file determines the header level. This
makes it easy to reorganize documentation and to share sections
with documentation for other programs.

If a file does not contain a header, a default one will be
inserted based on the filename. For example, if the file
Abstract.txt just contains a paragraph of abstract and no <h> tag,
the string <h>Abstract</h> will be inserted at the top of the file
during conversion. I expect many sections to have the same name as
the file, so this should save some typing.

<i>italics</i>

<b>bold</b>

<u>underline</u>

<ul>
<li>List
<li>Of
<li>Bullets
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Numbered
<li>List
<li>Of
<li>Points
</ol>

<p>Paragraph need to start with <p> Only paragraphs that start
with a paragraph mark will be separated in the output. Blank lines
are all removed during conversion.

<pre>...</pre>
Text To Display in Courier fixed-width font, preserving line
breaks as they are typed. Helpful for text tables like:
DSN   Filename
  1   One.wdm
 10   Ten.wdm
134   OneThreeFour.wdm

Also helpful for displaying code samples.


<figure>Label for a figure, to be included in table of figures</figure>

<img src="Screenshot.gif">
Include an image. If the image is not in the same directory, use relative
paths such as <img src="../images/Screenshot.gif">

<toc>
Builds a table of contents of the topics that are "children" of this one.

<indexword="WDM">
Creates a word in the HTML Help index that refers to this section

<keyword="HSPF">
Creates the same index entry that indexword creates, plus creates a 
button in HTML Help that pops open a window with links to all 
the other topics that share this keyword.

<body bgcolor="0xffffff" background="SubtleLogo.gif">
Override the current body style (if any) just for this file.
This is standard HTML and only has an effect in HTML and HTMLHelp.

Tables

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
     <td>Heading One</td>
     <td>Heading Two</td>
     <td>Heading Three</td>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tr>
     <td>Column One Row One</td>
     <td>Column Two Row One</td>
     <td>Column Three Row One</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
     <td>Column One Row Two</td>
     <td>Column Two Row Two</td>
     <td>Column Three Row Two</td>
 </tr>
</table>

HYPERLINKS

A simple link to another page:
<a href="../OtherSection/Filename">Link Text</a>

To have a link go to a particular part of a page:
<a href="../OtherSection/Filename#Place In Page to Link To">Link Text</a>
Also insert this at the place the link leads to:
<a name="Place In Page to Link To">
Section headers automatically get <a name="Header of Section"> tags added to them.

If the path starts with a slash, the correct relative path will be generated
during convert: <a href="/icons/x.gif"> might become <a href="../../icons/x.gif">
If you are linking to a web page: <a href="http://foo.gov/index.html">
If you want the web page to open in a separate browser window instead of the
help viewer: <a href="http://foo.gov/index.html" target="_blank">


Do not include the following in your source files, they will confuse the converter:
<html>
<head>
<form>

Other HTML tags will be preserved in the HTML and HTML Help output
but will be lost in the printable document and old-style Windows
help file.
