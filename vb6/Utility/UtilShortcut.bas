'How to register and un-register ActiveX Controls
'
'This tip describes how ActiveX controls can be registered and unregistered directly from Visual Basic.  Every ActiveX control
'contains two functions that can be called that will instruct the OCX to either register or un-register itself with the system.
'These functions are DLLRegisterServer and DLLUnregisterServer.  The following tip demonstrates how to register and
'un-register the Microsoft Common Controls OCX, ComCtl32.OCX.
'
'Declarations
'
'Copy the following code into the declarations section of your projects.
'
'Declare Function RegComCtl32 Lib "ComCtl32.OCX" _
'Alias "DllRegisterServer" () As Long
'
'Declare Function UnRegComCtl32 Lib "ComCtl32.OCX" _
'Alias "DllUnregisterServer" () As Long
'
'Const ERROR_SUCCESS = &H0
'
'Code
'
'To register the Microsoft Common Controls, use this code:
'
'If RegComCtl32 = ERROR_SUCCESS Then
'    MsgBox "Registration Successful"
'Else
'    MsgBox "Registration Unsuccessful"
'End If
'
'If UnRegComCtl32 = ERROR_SUCCESS Then
'    MsgBox "UnRegistration Successful"
'Else
'    MsgBox "UnRegistration Unsuccessful"
