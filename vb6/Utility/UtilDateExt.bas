'     and 90 minutes are incompatible.  Comparison of time units
'     and time steps which cross the day-month boundry are handled
'     a little different.  If the smaller time step is a day or
'     less and is compatible with 1 day and the larger time step
'     is compatible with one month, than the smaller and the
'     larger time steps are considered to be compatible.  The time
