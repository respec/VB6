' Visual Basic 4.0 16/32 Capture Routines
'
' This module contains several routines for capturing windows into a
' picture.  All the routines work on both 16 and 32 bit Windows
' platforms.
' The routines also have palette support.
'
' CreateBitmapPicture - Creates a picture object from a bitmap and
' palette
' CaptureWindow - Captures any window given a window handle
' CaptureActiveWindow - Captures the active window on the desktop
' CaptureForm - Captures the entire form
' CaptureClient - Captures the client area of a form
' CaptureScreen - Captures the entire screen
' PrintPictureToFitPage - prints any picture as big as possible on
' the page
'
' NOTES
'    - No error trapping is included in these routines
