<P>14. Model Use Features:  Graphical user interface, strong pre- and post-processing capabilities, linkages to GIS.</P>
<P>One of the strong sides of the DHI Receiving Waters Model suite is the modular structure under which they are developed. Specific modules covering different components of receiving waters modelling packages are available (e.g. surface run-off, non-cohesive and cohesive sediment transport and morphological processes, water quality processes etc.). Components can be combined for integrated modelling or may be run on individual basis.</P>

<P>15. Model Support:  Strong model documentation, manuals, on-line help, technical support, hot-line e-mail/phone, training courses (both in-house <BR>

<U>
<P>General Description </P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The MIKE system is a professional engineering software package containing a comprehen-sive modelling system for simulation of flows, hydraulics, water quality and sediment transport in streams, rivers, irrigation systems, channels, reservoirs, estuaries, bays, coastal areas and seas.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The MIKE system is a result of years of continuous development and each of the systems is tuned through experience gained from many worldwide applications. Today, the MIKE system is provided with a modern user-friendly interface facilitating the application of the system and a wide range of support software for use in data preparation. Analysis of simulation results and graphical presentation is included.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The model system is divided into 3-software groups; MIKE 11 (the 1-dimensional model), MIKE 21 (the 2-dimensional model) and MIKE 3 (the 3-dimensional model). The 3 model groups all consist of a wide range of different modules which are optional, but where the hydrodynamic module (HD) is the governing module.</P>
<P> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
MIKE 3: MIKE 3 HD solves the time-dependent conservation equations of mass and momentum in three dimensions, the so-called Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. In a stratified environment the conservation equations for heat and salt are included in the solution, and the turbulence fluctuations (Reynolds stress) are modelled employing the Boussinesq eddy viscosity concept. In MIKE 3 a total number of five different turbulent closures are available: constant eddy viscosity; Smagorinsky subgrid scale model; k-model; k-<FONT FACE="Symbol">e</FONT> model; mixed Smagorinsky/ k-<FONT FACE="Symbol">e</FONT> model.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For MIKE 21 and MIKE 3 different options of the computational grid are available; rectangular grid including dynamically nesting of fine grid areas and curve-linear grid.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When having decided upon the model which addresses the problem in question, a wide range of different modules are available depending upon the nature of the problem: Advection-dispersion module (AD), Particle module (PA), Water quality module (WQ), Eutrophication module (EU), Xenobiotics module (XE) including heavy metals, pesticides, PAH etc., Mud transport module (MT), Sediment transport, Spill analysis module (SA) including oil spill, 5 different wave modules (NSW, EMS, PMS, OSW; BW) and more.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>The right combination of modules should provide any engineer or authority with a useful tool in addressing problems and management of:<BR>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>flood control and operations</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>hydropower studies</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>storm drainage analysis,</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>water quality management</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>wave studies</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>soil erosion and transport studies</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>risk assessment</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>fate and transport of pathogens</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>etc</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of the models can be set-up in hind-cast, now-cast or forecast depending of the problem and data availability. Also, various degrees of implementing the models can be assessed; from simple set-up using experience and literature as the main data source to very complex set-up implementing e.g. data assimilation.</P>

<P>For more info on the model packages, see: http://www.dhisoftware.com/index.htm.</P>
<U>
<P>Model Methods include the following:</P>
</U>
<P>This depends of the different modules:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>3-dimensional: implicit conservation equations of mass and momentum in three dimensions.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The particle and oil spill modules are based on a Lagrangian approach whereas e.g. the remaining modules are based on an Euler approach.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the rest of the modules different methods are applied; in the eutrophication module, primary production with different types of plankton and even different algae species are included with the corresponding nutrient cycles, oxygen production and respiration. Also the sediment fluxes of nutrients can be included as well as rooted vegetation. In the water quality module pathogen and different components as ammonia, nitrate and BOD/DO can be in-cluded as both non-cohesive as well as cohesive sediments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>In this small section it will be too comprehensive to include all the different methods involved in the various modules.  Reference is made to <A HREF="http://www.dhisoftware.com/index.htm">http://www.dhisoftware.com/index.htm</A>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limitations:</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All models have limitations. In the modules included in the MIKE series, this is also the case, but the number of modules does not allow for a thorough description of these. Most limitations are due to the fact that in all the modules some assumptions are made and some processes are assumed to be of less importance so they have been excluded in order to save computational time. This also means that with the rapid increase of computer power, fewer limitations are included in the models.</P>

<U><P>Application History:</P>
</U>
<P>At DHI – Water &amp; Environment the MIKE 11 model was the first model to be developed – this started back in the 1960’s. Hereafter came MIKE 21 which is from the 1970’s and MIKE 3 which is from the 1980’s.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the models have been developed continuously incorporating new techniques and experience gained in research projects and an extensive amount of worldwide applications. Today the models still undergo development – especially due to fast growing computer power. The latter has allowed for significant increase in the amount of computational points (smaller grid size), increase in the amount of components and an increase in the model areas. </P>
