<U><P>General Description </P>
</U>
<P>HEM-3d is an integrated hydrodynamic and eutrophycation model. Though developed specifically for use in estuaries and coastal seas, it may be applied to lakes and reservoirs as well. The hydrodynamic and water quality portions of the model are internally linked, while their computations are decoupled (Park et al. 1998). This makes the revision of program code for kinetic processes much easier.</P>
<P>The hydrodynamic portion of the model is essentially the  EFDC (Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code), which may be run alone. The eutrophication portion of the model has to be run together with hydrodynamic model, though larger time step is permissible. There is a benthic flux model included in the eutrophication model.</P>

<P>Application History</P>
</U><P>.</P>
<P>The hydrodynamic portion of the model was developed by J. M. Hamrick (1992) while he was at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), and named EFDC. The eutrophication and benthic flux portions of the model were subsequently added into the EFDC by Park, et al.(1995), and the whole model package was named HEM-3d (3-dimensional Hydrodynamic-Eutrophycation Model), which complemented the other two models, HEM-1d and HEM-2d, also developed at VIMS.  The model has been applied for basic as well as practical studies, see Application References for examples</P>
