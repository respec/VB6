<P>General Description </P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CE-QUAL-RIV1 is a one-dimensional (cross-sectionally averaged) hydrodynamic and water quality model, meaning that the model resolves longitudinal variations in hydraulic and quality characteristics and is applicable where lateral and vertical variations are small. CE-QUAL-RIV1 consists of two parts, hydrodynamic and water quality.  Each of these parts is a separate computer code (RIV1H, the <U>H</U>ydrodynamic code and RIV1Q, the water <U>Q</U>uality code).  The hydrodynamic code is applied first to predict water transport and its results are written to a file, which is then read by the quality model.  It can be used to predict one-dimensional hydraulic and water quality variations in streams and rivers with highly unsteady flows, although it can also be used for prediction under steady flow conditions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RIV1Q can predict variations in each of twelve state variables: temperature, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD), organic nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate + nitrite nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, organic phosphorus, dissolved phosphates, algae, dissolved iron, dissolved manganese, and coliform bacteria.  In addition, the impacts of macrophytes can be simulated.  Numerical accuracy for the advection of sharp gradients is preserved in the water quality code through the use of the explicit two-point, fourth-order accurate, Holly-Preissman scheme.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The model that serves as the basis for CE-QUAL-RIV1 was originally developed at Ohio State University at the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the purpose of predicting water quality associated with storm water runoff.  Researchers at the U.S.&nbsp;Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES) were attracted to the model because it was fully dynamic for determining flow and water quality and it had several desirable numerical features, such as a two-point fourth order scheme for accurately predicting the advection of water quality concentrations.  The WES contracted Ohio State University to modify the model code to handle control structures.  This modification, along with the unsteady flow feature, gave the model the versatility needed for simulating Corps of Engineers regulated stream/waterway projects.  Subsequently, the updated version was tested at WES, and additional modifications and corrections were made, resulting in Version 1.0 of CE-QUAL-RIV1, released in 1991.  WES further modified and supported CE-QUAL-RIV1, releasing Version 2.0 of the model in 1995 (Environmental Laboratory 1995).</P>

<U><P>Limitations</P>
</U>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc394202544">Water Quality</A>: </B>The water quality algorithms for the conventional pollutants simulated by CE-QUAL-RIV1 are relatively comprehensive, in comparison with other available water quality models.  However, there are a number of processes not simulated by the model.  For example, the model does not include sediment transport processes such as scour and deposition and their impact on water quality.  Additionally, the model does simulate processes in the sediments affecting rates of oxygen demand and nutrient releases.  Instead, these rates are specified to the model.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc394202545">Numerical</A>: </B>The numerical solution scheme used by both the hydrodynamic and quality models are robust.  However, their may be situations where the solution schemes used in the hydrodynamic model will not converge on a stable solution.  The model may also predict negative solutions over &quot;overshoots&quot; due to phase errors, particularly at the leading edge of a storm wave.  These errors can usually be corrected by smoothing. <A NAME="_Toc394202547"></P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Computer Limits</A>: </B>While both the hydrodynamic and water quality components of CE-QUAL-RIV1 use efficient solution schemes, computer efficiency places limits on model applications in terms of computer memory and the time required to perform a simulation.  For example, it is common that several hundred simulations be conducted over the course of a model application.  Continuous simulations for relatively long time periods (months to years) may also be required in many applications.  As the time required for a typical simulation increases, the practicality of the model decreases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc394202548">Input Data</A>: </B>While the availability of input data is not a limitation of the model itself, it does place limits on the application of the model.  For example, if in-stream data are not available for comparison with model predictions, the model’s accuracy can not be assessed. </P>
