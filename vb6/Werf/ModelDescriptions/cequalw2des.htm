<P>General Description </P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CE-QUAL-W2 is a two-dimensional, longitudinal/vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model that has now been successfully applied to over 200 rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries in the U.S. and throughout the world.  The model is based upon a finite difference solution of the laterally and layer averaged equations of fluid motion.  The philosophy behind model development has been to provide an accurate solution to the original governing equations, include capabilities to model all the important hydrodynamic processes known to occur in the prototype. Additionally, the model was developed with the philosophy that the user should have the ability to make the representation of the prototype as simple or as complicated as the available data and questions to be addressed require.  The model includes the following capabilities:</P>

The model also includes a zero- and/or first-order sediment compartment that allows for delivery and decay of organic matter to the sediments.  The sediment compartment allows for release of inorganic nutrients back to the water column during hypoxic/anoxic conditions.</P>

<U><P>Application History</P>
</U>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Version 1.0</B>.  CE-QUAL-W2 has been under continuous development since 1975.  The original model was known as LARM (<B><I>L</B></I>aterally <B><I>A</B></I>veraged <B><I>R</B></I>eservoir <B><I>M</B></I>odel) developed by Edinger and Buchak (1975).  The first LARM application was on a reservoir with no branches.  Subsequent modifications to allow for multiple branches and estuarine boundary conditions resulted in the code known as GLVHT (<B><I>G</B></I>eneralized <B><I>L</B></I>ongitudinal-<B><I>V</B></I>ertical <B><I>H</B></I>ydrodynamics and <B><I>T</B></I>ransport Model).  Addition of the water quality algorithms by the Water Quality Modeling Group at the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES) resulted in CE-QUAL-W2 Version 1.0 (Environmental and Hydraulic Laboratories, 1986).</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Version 2.0</B>.  Version 2.0, released in 1995, was a result of major modifications to the code to improve the mathematical description of the prototype and increase computational accuracy and efficiency.  Considerable effort was made to make the model easier to use.  Version 2.0 has subsequently been applied to over 250 rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries in the U.S. and throughout the world and is now the reservoir model of choice for the USACE, USGS, USBR, TVA, and EPA.  The</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Version 3.0</B>.  Version 3.0, which will officially be released in August 2000, was developed to provide state-of-the-art capabilities for water quality modeling of entire waterbasins.  A change of coordinates was introduced in the x and z-momentum equations so that the z direction is now perpendicular to the bed slope rather than aligned parallel with gravity.  Also included was the ability to model different waterbodies within the same grid.  Both of these improvements resulted in the ability to model any number of waterbodies (stream, river, lake, reservoir, and estuaries) simultaneously in the same grid, thus allowing for modeling entire waterbasins.  A number of other hydrodynamic capabilities were added including the ability to model highly engineered systems that include pipes, pumps, and weirs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Numerous additional water quality capabilities were added including the previously stated multiple arbitrary constituents, algal groups, inorganic suspended solids, organic carbon, and CBOD groups.  Dissolved gas was also added.  Additionally, the ability to compute and view advective, diffusive, and kinetic fluxes for each state variable were added to aid in water quality calibration.</P>

<U><P>Model Use Features</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The model has a GUI pre and postprocessor.  Several other pre/postprocessors are available through private consulting firms for a fee.  By the end of 2000, the model should be incorporated into the Watershed Modeling System (WMS) with seamless integration to HSPF</P>
