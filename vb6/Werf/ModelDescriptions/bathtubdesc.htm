<U><P>General Description</U>:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eutrophication has several direct and indirect effects on reservoir water quality and uses.  Three computer programs are designed to assist in the phases of data gathering and model implementation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>FLUX – estimation of tributary nutrient loadings from grab-sample concentration data and continuous flow records using a variety of calculation methods which permit quantification of potential errors and evaluation of alternative sampling program designs.</LI></P></OL>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b.&#9;PROFILE – display and reduction of pool water quality data, including calculation of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates, characterization of spatial and temporal variability, and robust statistical summary of mixed-layer concentration data.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<OL START=3 TYPE="a">

<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>BATHTUB – implementation of nutrient balance models and eutrophication response models in a Spatially-segmented hydraulic network which accounts for advective transport, diffusive transport, and nutrient sedimentation.</LI></P></OL>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>d.&#9;FLUX- grab sample concentration data and continuous flow records,  </P>
<P>e.&#9;PROFILE – vertical profiles of water quality data at one or more sample stations throughout the period of interest,</P>
<P>f.&#9;BATHTUB – information describing watershed characteristics, water and nutrient loads, and lake or reservoir morphology.  Observed lake or reservoir water quality data are desirable.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Model Input</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Model methods include the following</U>:</P>

<P>Three interrelated programs (FLUX, PROFILE, and BATHTUB) simplify assessments of eutrophication-related processes and effects.</P>

<P>&#9;FLUX – Program allows estimation of tributary mass discharges (loadings) for sample concentration data and continuous <I>(e.g., </I>daily) flow records.  Five estimation methods are available and potential errors in estimates are quantified.</P>

<P>&#9;PROFILE – Program facilitates analysis and reduction of in-lake water quality data.  Algorithms are included for calculation of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates and estimation of area-weighted, surface-layer mean concentrations of nutrients and other eutrophication response variables.</P>

<P>&#9;BATHTUB – Applies a series of empirical eutrophication models to morphologically complex lakes and reservoirs.  The program performs steady-state water and nutrient balance calculations in a spatially segmented hydraulic network which accounts for advective and diffusive transport, and nutrient sedimentation.  Eutrophication-related water quality conditions (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll-a, transparency, and hypolimnetic oxygen depletion) are predicted using em-pirical relationships derived from assessments of reservoir data.</P>
<U>
<P>Limitations:</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Applications of BATHTUB are limited to steady-state evaluations of relations between nutrient loading, transparency and hydrology, and eutrophication responses.  Short-term and effects related to structural modifications or responses to variables other than nutrients cannot be explicitly evaluated.</P>

<U><P>Application History:</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programs and models have been applied to United States Army Corps of Engineer reservoirs as well as a number of other lakes and reservoirs.  BATHTUB was recently cited as an effective tool for lake and reservoir water quality assessment and management, particularly when data are limited.</P>

<U><P>Model Use Features:</P>
</U>
<P>Model processes include nutrient and water balances in a segmented hydraulic network, nutrient sedimentation, algal (chlorophyll) response to flushing, light and nutrient concentration and hypolimnetic oxygen depletion.</P>
