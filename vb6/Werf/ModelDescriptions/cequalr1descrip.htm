<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> CE-QUAL-R1 is a mathematical model of water quality that describes the vertical distribution of thermal energy and biological and chemical materials in a reservoir through time. It is typically used to study pre-impoundment and post-impoundment water quality problems and the effects of reservoir management operations on water quality. The model also addresses problems of water quality associated with reservoir eutrophication with possible anaerobic conditions. CE-QUAL-R1 simulates the dynamics of 27 water quality variables, calculating both vertical in-pool and downstream release magnitudes. In addition, 11 other variables, which represent materials in the sediments are modeled. </P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Model methods include the following:</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Water quality problems that can be addressed by CE-QUAL-R1 include: a. Onset, extent, and duration of thermal stratification. b. Location of selective withdrawal ports required to meet a downstream temperature objective. c. Effect of structural modifications on water quality d. The development of anoxic conditions. e. Magnitude, composition, and timing of algal blooms. f. Factors affecting growth of algae and macrophytes. g. Effects of storm events on in-pool and release water quality. h. Effects of upstream land use on in-pool and release water quality. i. Effects of project operations changes such as: (1) Altered release level. (2) Change in minimum or maximum release rates. (3) Pool elevation changes. (4) Destratification. (5) Changes in scheduled operations. </P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limitations</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The model assumes a reservoir can be represented by a vertical series of well-mixed horizontal layers. The model limitations associated with this assumption are: a. Longitudinal and lateral variations in water quality constituents cannot be predicted. b. All inflow quantities and constituents are instantaneously dispersed throughout the horizontal layers. c. Model predictions are probably most representative of water quality conditions near the dam or in the deepest part of the reservoir. </P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of utilities are provided with CE-QUAL-R1.  These include preprocessors, which are aids in assembling a usable data set, two graphic utilities, statistics for comparing measured and predicted data, and a flux model.  The flux model calculates and lists the rates of change for all biological processes, which should aid the users of CE-QUAl-R1 to correctly predict variable concentrations.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Users Manual:</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The manual is organized into five major parts with several appendixes.  In Part I, CE-QUAL-R1 is introduced to the reader by summarizing its major usages, attributes, and historical development.  Part II addresses model capabilities, assumptions and limitations, and basic equations.  It supplies the necessary information to understand the model without getting into specific details.  Part III is concerned with specific constructs of CE-QUAL-R1.  It describes each subroutine in detail.  Part IV describes how to determine the various coefficients, constants, and updates required by CE-QUAL-R1.  It also describes how to calibrate the model and interpret output.  Part V describes a number of the utilities associated with CE-QUAL-R1.  The appendices include: A, a glossary of computer variables used in Part III; B, examples of output; C, a diagram describing the data records needed for various simulation options; D, a diagram describing the structure of data sets; E, examples of data sets; and F, information concerning CE-THERM-R1, the thermal portion of CE-QUAL-R1.</P>
