Todd has added some documentation in the source code for this
control. If the following documentation is not enough, I suggest 
browsing through the source code or talking with Todd.

When you are populating the control, these are the
important parts:

.maxFields
 The maximum number of fields per view. Set this before calling
 Clear. The default value is 100, so you will probably not need to
 set a different one.
 Example:
        .maxFields = 100

.nViews
 The number of views to be displayed. Must be set before calling
 Clear. 
 Example:
        .nViews = 10

.Clear 
 Removes all the strings from the control and allocates internal
 arrays for storing view and field names.
 Example:
        .Clear

.nFields (view As Long) As Long
 Number of fields in each view. Must be set after calling Clear.
 Example:
        .nFields(1) = 2   'First view contains two fields

.Views(I As Long)
 An array of view names to be displayed. Start with Views(1).
 Example: 
        .Views(1) = "Site"
        .Views(2) = "WUSite"

.Fields(view As long, field As long, newvalue As string)
 A two-dimensional array of strings in the control
 indexed by view and field.
 Example:
        .Fields(1, 1) = "SiteID"
        .Fields(1, 2) = "SiteName"
 
.InitLists
 Puts all the view and field names in the tree control.
 Call this after setting all Views and Fields.
 Example:
        .InitLists
